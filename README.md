TX0RX0-Kicad-Libraries
======================

Library of the parts used in our boards and converted from other libraries for use in kicad.

A few of our parts come from Sparkfun. They usually have conversion errors to kicad, and we try to fix them. 
If you find any, feel free to let us know. The rest are handrawn/modified by us. 

The symbols file for eeschema is in the symbols folder and the footprints file for pcbnew is in the footprints folder. 
The mojo folder contains seperate libraries for a MOJO FPGA board symbol and footprint. These are also included in the
main libraries, so you don't need to download that if you're getting the main files

You are free to use any of these parts in your designs, for any final use. If you make something cool, let us know. 
I like cool things. Feel free to send me any parts you've designed, and I'll look at adding them

If you have any contributions or questions, feel free to email us at tx0rx0labs@gmail.com, or visit
