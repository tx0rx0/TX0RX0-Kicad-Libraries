TX0RX0-Kicad-Libraries
======================

Library of the parts used in our boards and converted from other libraries for use in kicad.

A few of our parts come from Sparkfun. They usually have conversion errors to kicad, and we try to fix them. 
If you find any, feel free to let us know.

You are free to use any of these parts in your designs, for any reason. If you make something cool, let us know. 
I like cool things.

If you have any contributions or questions, feel free to email us at tx0rx0labs@gmail.com, or visit
